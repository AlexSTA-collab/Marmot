This is the implementation of the gradient-enhanced micropolar element.
Mathematically, it is identical to Eringen's Microstretch theory,
i.e,  the micropolar continuum + an additional scalar eq. describing the relation between macriscopic and microscropic dilation.

This implemenation makes use of the Fastor library (https://github.com/romeric/Fastor, hard dependency)
for all tensor contractions.
